    "A number of students are asked to roll a six-sided dice several times. The variable orig_data_list is a list containing the outcomes of these rolls. Each entry in the list corresponds to a student. For example, when orig_data_list is of the form: [[3,4,2,6], [1,8,2,5], [4,3,2,3], [5,2,6,3], [2,nan, 5,1], [1,1,2,5]] we know that six students rolled a dice four times each. The first student rolled a 3, 4, 2 and 6. Note that some entries are nan and others are outside of the range 1-6 to reflect inaccuracies in the data collection process. Your task is to analyse properties of this list. \n",
