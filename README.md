Anumber of students are asked to roll a six-sided dice several times. The variable orig_data_list is a list containing the outcomes of these rolls. Each entry in the list corresponds to a student. For example, when orig_data_list is of the form: [[3,4,2,6], [1,8,2,5], [4,3,2,3], [5,2,6,3], [2,nan, 5,1], [1,1,2,5]] we know that six students rolled a dice four times each. The first student rolled a 3, 4, 2 and 6. Note that some entries are nan and others are outside of the range 1-6 to reflect inaccuracies in the data collection process. Your task is to analyse properties of this list. A list of functions that may be helpful include the following: • all, dict, len, list, print, range, round, sorted, str • dict.keys(), dict.values(), dict.get() You may also wish to look up if, for and while loops as well as Python comprehensions. If you are not familiar with any of these functions, do not be concerned. There are often numerous ways to answer each question, and you may find you do not use any or all of the suggested functions.
